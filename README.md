- How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
User needs should be interpreted through the lens of the user. It is very easy to get into a thought process that ends in you creating something that you think would work, but since the project wasn't thought through entirely with the user in mind, you lose the forest through the trees and the design might become unintuitive or cumbersome instead of fluid for the user. By creating "user stories" you can try to get into the mind of the user and think like they would. By writing their "demands" down, you can ensure that you are always proceeding forward with the thoughts and ideas of the users in mind. You also end up creating almost a "checklist" of user demands so that you can both sort them by priority and check them off as you complete the implementation of their demands.


- How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
You should approach developing programs through an agile process. By allowing alterations to an ongoing project, you are given the ability to be much more flexible than you would be able to with a waterfall method or some other methods that is more rigid. Additionally, you should ensure that as you are working, you are testing your work. If you were to wait until the end of the project to test and troubleshoot issues, then that is a calamity just waiting to happen. These are agile processes that you can incorporate into your future work. Another principle that is critical is making sure that you focus on teamwork throughout the sprint. If you try to take on all the roles of development yourself instead of trusting your team members to do their job, then you will end up impeding the progress of the team and the project instead of pushing it forward.

- What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
To be a good team member in software development means to work with your team through everything, with communication being a critical element that should be focused on. It is incredibly important to be transparent with your team members and to be honest with the abilities you have and the speed at which you can work at. Claiming that you can do something that you can't do will get you nowhere in terms of progress with whatever project you are working on.
